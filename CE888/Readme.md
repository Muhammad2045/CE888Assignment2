1: Repository for CE888 Assignment 2
2: This is a research based project for predicting the stress level of nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak using a machine learning model (Random Forest) and can be found at the given link https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01361-y#Tab1
3: The notebook file in the repository named FinalCode.py can be run in google collab, the reason for google collab is that there is a huge data around 12 Million.
4: The main dataset is available at https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.5hqbzkh6f
